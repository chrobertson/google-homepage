This is an attempt to recreate the Google homepage. I will be using what I've learned of HTML and CSS, including the basics of page layouts, design, links, CSS styling, classes, ids, and forms.

Reflection: This project ended up being more difficult than I imagine. I learned a lot about the effects parent elements have on their children and the way elements are positioned on a webpage. Learned to use Google Chrome's developer tools to quickly make adjustments to and test code.
